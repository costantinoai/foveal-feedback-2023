# **fMRI Analysis Repository**

---

### 🌟 **Overview**:
This repository is dedicated to the statistical analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Its primary focus lies on multi-variate pattern analysis (MVPA) and polynomial regression of classification outcomes across subjects, conditions, and regions of interest (ROIs).
